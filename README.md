# Design patterns showcase

-- This repo is under construction ! -- <br>
-- I know more than this repo is reflecting. It is just a matter of time before most of the 23 patterns are up. --

## What

So. I felt the need to brush up on some design pattern skills in both Python and Java.
Therefore, I am solving different kinds of patterns via problems I've found through
Refactoring Guru, ChatGPT (for reference, not generation) and GeeksForGeeks, among others.
Plan is to also do strictly GoF-patterns from examples in their book.

## Why?

I need this showcase, because this question arise a lot during my interviewing processes working as a consultant.
This is a complement to the projects I've been working on lately. Most of the code I write is closed source.
I can only showcase examples here, since I can't paste closed source code.. I hope I don't have to explain why..

## Time?

This repo will be updated sporadically. I am a busy man and this is just meant for showing skills in Python and Java.
Plan is to use some of the patterns in Go as well, even if my Go-repos probably are better for showing my skills there.

## Quality

I will make my best to add comments and instructions for every pattern. While this will not be production friendly code
I want to show off skills and knowledge of internals for each language represented here. Quality might not be of essence,
but a showcase for the field is what I am at here.
